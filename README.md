Enhancements to the VistA Kernel for GT.M. 

Products & Installation
-----------------------
Patch XU\*8.0\*10001 can be found in releases. Full release notes can be found there.

You can install this either using a KIDS build by unzipping the routines in the virgin_install.zip. You should always use the KIDS build unless you have a new system that you are building that doesn't have KIDS operational yet. In that case, you should unzip the files in virgin_install.zip into your routines directory.
