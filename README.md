Kernel-GTM
==========
Enhancements to the VistA Kernel for GT.M. 

Products & Installation
-----------------------
Patch XU\*8.0\*10001 & XU\*8.0\*10002 can be found in releases. Full release
notes can be found there.

You can install these either using a KIDS build by unzipping the routines in
the virgin_install.zip. You should always use the KIDS build unless you have
a new system that you are building that doesn't have KIDS operational yet. In
that case, you should unzip the files in virgin_install.zip into your routines
directory.

The KIDS builds provided are combined: BOTH XU\*8.0\*10001 and XU\*8.0\*10002
are in a sequential KIDS build.
